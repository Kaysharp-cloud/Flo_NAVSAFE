# FLO-NAVSAFE: Flood Navigation and Safety Application

The **Flood Inundation Map (FIM)** displayed on the home page of the FLO-NAVSAFE application is sourced from NOAAâ€™s National Water Model (NWM):  
[https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/nwm/ana_inundation_extent/FeatureServer/0](https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/nwm/ana_inundation_extent/FeatureServer/0)

## ðŸš€ Forecast Page and Automation Pipeline  

The forecast page of the application is powered by an automated workflow located in the `Scripts` folder:

- **get_nwm_sr_forecast.py** â€“ Downloads short-range discharge forecasts from the NWM.  
- **Fim_generation.py** â€“ Uses the ArcGIS Pro Python environment to generate forecasted Flood Inundation Maps (FIMs).  
- **automation.py** â€“ Orchestrates the hourly execution of `get_nwm_sr_forecast.py` and `Fim_generation.py`.  

All required Python packages for running the scripts are listed in **`nwm.yml`**.

## ðŸ““ Jupyter Notebooks  

Fully documented notebooks are provided in the `Notebooks` folder for transparency and reproducibility:

- **get_nwm_sr_forecast.ipynb** â€“ Walkthrough of the discharge download process.  
- **FIM_generation.ipynb** â€“ Step-by-step documentation of the FIM generation workflow.
